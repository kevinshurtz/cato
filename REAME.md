# Cato

A fun Discord bot to share the wisdom and wit of Cato the Elder.

# Background

## Who is Cato the Elder?

Cato the Elder was a Roman Senator between the second and third Punic wars, and
was great grandfather to Cato the Younger, a legendary political opponent of
Julias Caesar.

Cato the Elder is well known for his severe Roman manners, opposition to
Hellenization, and his strong insistence upon the destruction of
Carthage.

The latter point is perhaps his most famous attributed.  After becoming
convinced that an ascendant Carthage was Rome's greatest threat, Cato concluded
every Senate speech - regardless of topic - with the phrase, "ceterum autem
censeo Carthaginem esse delendam", or "furthermore, I consider that Carthage
must be destroyed."

## Why was this project made?

This project was initially created as a fun way to toy with my friends during a
game of Sid Meier's Civilization VI.

In particular, I thought it would be amusing to have Cato fix his ire on my
Phoenician counterparts as the game unfolded.
